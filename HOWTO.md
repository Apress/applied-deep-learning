# Applied Deep Learning - A Case-Based Approach to Understanding Deep Neural Networks

### By Umberto Michelucci

Welcome to the github repository for the book "Applied Deep Learning - A Case-Based Approach to Understanding Deep Neural Networks". Here you will find the jupyter notebooks that I used during the completion of the book. Please note that

- All the code you need is 100% in the book, so you don't need to copy any code from here if you are following the book.
- Here you will find "companion" code that will help you learning how to work with the concept explained in the book.
- The jupyter notebooks you will find here contained similar code you will find in the book, but sometimes to produce the figures I had to re-run the same piece of code with different parameters, and it may not be reflected in the jupyter notebooks you find here.
- In the notebooks you will find exercises and solutions that you can use in case you are a **teacher**.

**HOW TO USE**: those jupiter notebooks should be used to help you in understanding and trying the concepts explained in the book. They are the ones I use in my university courses, so if you are a __teacher__ they should be helpful. Get in touch in case you have questions or remarks or you need to talk with me since you want to use them for teaching.

Feel free to use them, change them and distribute them. A reference would be nice ;-)
